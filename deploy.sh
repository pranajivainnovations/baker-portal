# Why this exists: "is that change live?" was being answered from memory, by both a human and an
# assistant reading the repo, and memory was wrong often enough to waste real time — a fix sat in
# the working tree through two production builds while everyone believed it had shipped, and
# separately, work that HAD shipped was repeatedly described as pending.
#
# The file answers it from evidence instead. The decisive field is `tree`: `clean` means the commit
# named beside it is exactly what shipped, so `git log <sha>..HEAD` lists everything since. `dirty`
# means uncommitted files were part of the build, so the commit alone does not identify the deploy —
# then the timestamp is what to compare against, and anything modified after it is unshipped.
#
# Append-only, newest entry LAST. `tail -12 DEPLOYED.md` shows the most recent deploy.

TARBALL="${IMAGE_NAME}.tgz"

# ── Server disk hygiene ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Repeated deploys fill the server, and the failure lands at the worst possible moment: the image
# tarball has already been uploaded and `docker load` is halfway through extracting it. On a script
# that stopped the container first, the service is then down with no image to start.
#
# Two causes, both invisible until they bite:
#
#   1. Every `docker load` of the same :latest tag untags the previous image rather than deleting
#      it. Twenty-one of these had accumulated on the storefront host over three weeks, one per
#      deploy, ~280MB each. Nothing ever collects them.
#   2. The uploaded .tgz is never removed. Five of them, back to May, were sitting in the deploy
#      directories on one host — 498MB doing nothing.
#
# Note the prune below is deliberately NOT `-a`. `docker image prune -a` removes every image not
# used by a *running* container, and these hosts run several services side by side: if any other
# service happened to be stopped at that moment, its image would be deleted too and it could not
# restart without a fresh upload. `-a` also throws away the previous image, which is the only
# rollback available when a new one turns out to be broken. Dangling-only removes exactly the
# garbage and nothing that anything could still want.
